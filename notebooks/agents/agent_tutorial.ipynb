Legends speak of ancient spirits that dwell within, their voices carried by the wind to those who dare to listen.\\n\\n**Chapter 1: The Call of the Forest**\\nIn the village of Elderglen, tales of the Whispering Woods were as common as the morning sun. Elders spoke of a time when the forest was alive with magic, a sanctuary for creatures of myth and wonder. Young Elara, a curious soul with a heart full of adventure, felt an irresistible pull towards the woods.\\n\\n**Chapter 2: The Enchanted Path**\\nOne crisp autumn morning, Elara set out on a journey to uncover the secrets of the forest. As she stepped onto the leaf-strewn path, the trees seemed to lean in, their branches forming a protective archway. The air was filled with a symphony of rustling leaves and distant whispers.\\n\\n**Chapter 3: Guardians of the Grove**\\nDeep within the heart of the woods, Elara encountered the Guardians‚Äîethereal beings who watched over the forest. They spoke of a hidden realm where time stood still, a place where dreams and reality intertwined. To enter, one must prove their heart's true intent.\\n\\n**Chapter 4: The Trials of Truth**\\nGuided by the Guardians, Elara faced a series of trials, each designed to test her courage, wisdom, and compassion. She navigated through illusions, solved ancient riddles, and embraced the unknown, her spirit unwavering.\\n\\n**Chapter 5: The Heart of the Forest**\\nHaving passed the trials, Elara reached the heart of the forest‚Äîa serene glade bathed in golden light. Here, the whispers grew louder, revealing the forest's ancient secrets and the interconnectedness of all life. Elara realized her purpose: to be a bridge between the world of magic and the realm of man.\\n\\n**Conclusion: A New Beginning**\\nReturning to Elderglen, Elara shared her journey with the villagers, inspiring a newfound respect for the Whispering Woods. The forest, once a place of mystery, became a symbol of harmony and hope, its whispers a reminder of the magic that lies within us all.\\n\\n---\\n\\nFeel free to modify or expand upon this story as needed!\", ctx=None)], 'chat_history_str': None, 'examples': None, 'task_desc': '\\n<START_OF_TASK_SPEC>\\nYou are an excellent task planner.\\n\\nAnswer the input query using the tools provided below with maximum accuracy.\\n\\nEach step you will read the previous thought, Action(name, kwargs), and Observation(execution result of the action) and then provide the next Thought and Action\\nfollowing the output format in <START_OF_OUTPUT_FORMAT> <END_OF_OUTPUT_FORMAT>.\\n\\nFollow function docstring to best call the tool.\\n    - For simple queries: You can directly answer by setting `_is_answer_final` to True and generate the answer in the `_answer` field.\\n    - For complex queries:\\n        - Step 1: Read the user query and divide it into multisteps.

    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrated advanced AdalFlow agent features:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Human-in-the-Loop Features\n",
    "- **Basic Permission Management**: Tools requiring user approval before execution\n",
    "- **Auto-Approval Mode**: Automatic approval for development environments\n",
    "- **YOLO Mode**: Bypass all permission checks for trusted environments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Streaming Capabilities\n",
    "- **Basic Streaming**: Real-time execution events\n",
    "- **Raw Response Streaming**: Access to raw model outputs\n",
    "- **Agent Event Streaming**: High-level execution events\n",
    "- **Multi-Provider Streaming**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, and other providers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tracing and Monitoring\n",
    "- **Basic Tracing**: Built-in execution tracing\n",
    "- **MLflow Integration**: Enterprise-grade tracing and monitoring\n",
    "- **Async Generator Tools**: Advanced streaming tool execution with tracing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "1. Explore permission management for production deployments\n",
    "2. Set up MLflow for comprehensive tracing: `mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080`\n",
    "3. Experiment with streaming for real-time applications\n",
    "4. Check the AdalFlow documentation for more advanced features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits\n",
    "- **Safety**: Human oversight for critical operations\n",
    "- **Transparency**: Full visibility into agent execution\n",
    "- **Performance**: Real-time streaming for responsive applications\n",
    "- **Monitoring**: Enterprise-grade tracing and analytics"
